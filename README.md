# scrapy: r/subreddit_name

This is a python script that uses the scrapy library to collect a desired subreddit's posts' titles
and image links.

In particular, this crawler targets the subreddit "mildlyinteresting," however, one can change the
designated subreddit by editing the "start_urls" section in the mild.py settings.
